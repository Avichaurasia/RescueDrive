This GitHub repository hosts a Java-based web application for file storage and synchronization, leveraging technologies such as JSP, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Servlets. Users can easily set up the application locally and interact with its features, including file uploading, management, and synchronization across devices. I welcome contributions from fellow developers and have specified the project's licensing information to ensure clarity on usage rights.
